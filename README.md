# Wordpress Boilerplate
A boilerplate for Wordpress theme development, with useful plugins, included php libraries and some other cool stuff. This boilerplate is built with [Bootstrap v4.0.0-beta.2](http://getbootstrap.com/) using Bootstrap 4 source files, so... you might like to check-out their docs before even starting developing hehe.

#### This boilerplate requires some additional tooling:
- Sass compiler (Libsass or Ruby Sass is supported) for compiling your CSS.
- Autoprefixer for CSS vendor prefixing

or...

- Simply install [Koala](http://koala-app.com/)
