# Wordpress Boilerplate
A boilerplate for Wordpress theme development, with useful plugins, included php libraries and some other cool stuff. This boilerplate is built with [Bootstrap v4.0.0-beta.2](http://getbootstrap.com/) using Bootstrap 4 source files, so... you might like to check-out their docs before even starting developing hehe.

#### This boilerplate requires some additional tooling:
- Sass compiler (Libsass or Ruby Sass is supported) for compiling your CSS.
- Autoprefixer for CSS vendor prefixing

or...

- Simply install [Koala](http://koala-app.com/)

## JS Plugins
- jQuery 3.2.1: Obviously
- jQuery UI: Dude...
- SwiperJS: A cool slider
- WaypointsJS: A useful plugin for creating triggers on scroll
- FancyboxJS: A lightbox plugin
- OffCanvasJS: A mobile menu plugin
- CSS3 Animate It: Awesome and easy CSS3 animations with scrolling triggers

## PHP
- PHPMailer 5.2.23
