# Wordpress Boilerplate
A boilerplate for Wordpress theme development, with useful plugins, included php libraries and some other cool stuff. This boilerplate is built with [Bootstrap v4.0.0-beta.2](http://getbootstrap.com/) using Bootstrap 4 source files, so... you might like to check-out their docs before even starting developing hehe.

#### This boilerplate requires some additional tooling:
- Sass compiler (Libsass or Ruby Sass is supported) for compiling your CSS.
- Autoprefixer for CSS vendor prefixing

or...

- Simply install [Koala](http://koala-app.com/)

## JS Plugins
- **jQuery 3.2.1** (CDN): Obviously.
- **jQuery UI**: Dude...
- **SwiperJS 4.0.5** (CDN): A cool slider.
- **WaypointsJS**: A useful plugin for creating triggers on scroll.
- **FancyboxJS 3.1.20** (CDN): A lightbox plugin.
- **OffCanvasJS**: A mobile menu plugin.
- **CSS3 Animate It**: Awesome and easy CSS3 animations with scrolling triggers.

## PHP
